- all polymorphism(might be except pimpl) in c++ comes from two language features: template and virtual inheritance
- template is compile time polymorphism and can only be used at compile time
- virtual inheritance is runtime polymorphism and can be used at runtime
- one design pattern can be actualized both in compile time and runtime
- type erasure is combination of template and virtual inheritance
    - std::function is classic example of type erasure:
      - the template parameter is compile time polymorphism and can accept callable signature at compile time
      - after the compile time polymorphism, the signature is determinied, at runtime, std::function object can be bound to any callable time that conforms to this signature
      - as a result, the std::function itself can accept any signature at compile time and any callable object that is of the same signature type
