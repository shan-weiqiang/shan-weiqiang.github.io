- all polymorphism(might be except pimpl) in c++ comes from two language features: template and virtual inheritance
- template is compile time polymorphism and can only be used at compile time
- virtual inheritance is runtime polymorphism and can be used at runtime
- one design pattern can be actualized both in compile time and runtime
- type erasure is combination of template and virtual inheritance
