I talked about types in [Type systems: Part I](https://shan-weiqiang.github.io/2024/07/14/understanding-types.html), and discussed Google Protobuffers in [Type systems: Part II Protobuf Reflection](https://shan-weiqiang.github.io/2025/06/14/protobuf-reflection.html). Today I go deeper into another type, the most common one, json. Json is **inherently** dynamic, even though there are both dynamic and static interpreters.

* toc
{:toc}
