- definition requires memory 
- declaration only introduce names and types
- one definition rule
  - inside one tranlation unit, there must be only one definition
  - multiple definition in difference translation unit is allowed, which how template works
  - what happens if different static or dynamic libraries contain the same definition?
  - what if the definitions are the same?
- definitions inside class is implicitly inline
- static lib depends on dynamic lib--> since static lib are archive of object files,which are not linked, this dependency only means that this lib requires headers of the dynamic lib
- dynamic lib depends on static lib-->dynamic lib are *executables*, they exist at runtime; this dependency means that it requires the binary and the header of the static lib;
  we can say that the dynamic lib *absolves* the static lib, now the dynamic lib contains the code of the static lib, also requries the headers of the static lib
- in binary, there is only definitions: which are essentially symbols and code; declarations can be seen as only *symbols*
